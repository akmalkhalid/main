							<span class="w3-large" style="font-weight:800;">Fusion of Data-Driven and Theory-Driven Research: Towards Empathic Entertainment Field (2022--2023)</span><br>
							<p>For decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed with intelligent search techniques and powerful learning agents to adapt to competitive settings. This condition leads to the notion of robust AI, which systematically and reliably applies its data-driven knowledge to a wide range of problems synthesized from various sources. Thus, such AI agent can reason flexibly and dynamically about the world, transfer what it learns from one context to another, and finally build some form of trust. Meanwhile, entertainment science (ES) had started to gain momentum where aggregate value functions, enhanced affordance, improvised utility, and diverse reward systems were designed to making any process entertaining (i.e., gamification), measuring subjective outcome (i.e., engaging, fun, etc.), and quantifying affective characteristic (i.e., exciting, motivating, etc.). Bridging AI and ES in a game environment, provided the platform to benefit both sides, as a new form of the scientific venture while establishing common interests to understand better how those fields interact in popular media and other real-world problems. Such research has undergone concerted efforts that brought together game informatics, human-like AI, human-computer interactions, entertainment computing, game analytics, AI search, information system, and the like. As digital games have explored human-driven phenomena, AI agents that are emotionally sentient would enable complex tasks to be performed more effectively, make better decisions, and offer more practical and effective services. In the aftermath of COVID-19, the need to intertwine AI and ES was becoming more critical, especially in learning, services, safety, workforce, robotics, supply chain, manufacturing, etc. Overhaul in interaction design, physical and virtual stimuli, relative to co-creation and collaboration between human and machine, could be significantly impacted. The goal of the project is to realize empathic entertainment field as an innovative research field that enhances the understanding of human interactions and behaviors, psychologically or emotionally, by aggregating theory-driven method with data-driven techniques, using existing AI and ES technologies.</p>

							<span class="w3-large" style="font-weight:800;">Establishing A New Research Field of “Comfort in Mind” Science and Technology (2021--2022)</span><br>
							<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) in games had established several important research fields. For instance, solving games and general game-playing (GGP) have been a research platform for intelligent search techniques and generalizing language descriptions for game systems, respectively. However, such research directions emphasize functional utility and performance optimization (subject-independent). In contrast, the motion in mind concept synthesized the foundation of entertainment science by considering the analogy of physics and motions with the game-playing process by aggregating value functions and reward systems. Nevertheless, such a concept lacks experimental validation and empirical verification because of its subjective properties (subject-dependent). Preliminary findings showed that AI in games provides the utility to identify entertaining elements in games. However, such utilities are insufficient to assess the magnitude of distress and decompose the complexity of events with imperfect information. For instance, in the game context, determining a favorable situation depends on an efficient heuristic to identify “stable” moves among the various options of moves. Similarly, in a real-world context, long-term foresight of situations or strategic decision-making requires expertise and experience to achieve a favorable event outcome. Without big data, massive resource utilization, and specialized technical capability, machines cannot make accurate decisions and are ineffective compared to humans. Addressing such limitations, the purpose of this project is to bring together AI research and entertainment science, utilizing games to establish a new research field, coined as the “comfort in mind.”</p>

							<span class="w3-large" style="font-weight:800;">Determining the Effects of Global Warming to Depression Patients in Malaysia using Hybrid of Deep Recurrent Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model Approach (2019--2022)</span><br>
							<p>As reported by World Health Organization in 2017, the number of people affected with depression has reportedly increased in recent years. Several factors that cause the increased risk of depression are social economy factors, genetic traits, relationship, sleep deprived, environmental factors and others. However, one of the contributing factors that is least investigated in increasing risk of depression is the environmental factor specifically global warming, which recently reported by several researchers, has potentially increase the hospital admission rate of depression patients. In addition, there are also other supporting factors such as age of the depression patient and the type of residency (urban or rural) that correlate with the increase of the temperature. However, in Malaysia, these factors are less explored. Hence, exploring the impact of global warming in relation to age group and residency to the upswing rate of depression patient admission to hospital, is worth venturing. Therefore, the objectives of this study are: (1) Formulate the relationship of global warming, place of residency and age to the increasing rate of depression patient; (2) Determine the ambient temperature that impact adversely depression patients; and (3) Propose and evaluate a hybrid of DRNN-HMM approach to predict the increasing of rate of depression patients. Improved version of hybrid deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) offers a data-driven machine learning approach that able to formulate the impact of global warming, with added factors of age and residency, to the increase rate of depression. The expected implication of the study is a state-of-the art machine learning approach that able to formulate and alert the impact of the global warming to the depression patients in Malaysia. The output of the study is vital to aid the health experts to counter the issue of increased risk to them due to global warming.</p>
